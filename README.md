# Simar-Says
Simon Says game created on Android Studio. 

Simon Says is a game where 4 coloured squares appear. Then one square will light up. The user has to tap the square that lights up.

Afterwards, one square will light up and and then after another square will light up. The user has to tap the squares in the order that they light up.

The game continues like this until the user doesn't get the order right.

An aside: According to biology the human brain can only keep about 7 items in short term memory. Meaning that acheiving a score of higher than 7 probably means you have a good short term memory :)
